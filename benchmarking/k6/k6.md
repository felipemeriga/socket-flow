# Load Testing with k6

This guide explains how to execute load tests using the [k6](https://k6.io/) tool on an [echo server example](https://github.com/felipemeriga/socket-flow/blob/main/examples/echo_server.rs). The tests are designed to compare the performance of **socket-flow** against **tokio-tungstenite** in realistic scenarios.

---

## Getting Started

### **1. Building the Docker Image**
To perform the load tests, first build the Docker image for the echo server. Run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
docker build -f ./benchmarking/k6/Dockerfile -t socket-flow-echo-server .
```

### **2. Deploying the Container**
After building the image, push it to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, or Google Container Registry) and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster.

- **Cluster Setup**: Ensure the cluster has multiple replicas of the echo server to simulate a real-world scenario.
- **Scaling**: Configure horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) to handle increased traffic if needed.

> **Note:** All benchmarks were conducted in a Kubernetes cluster with production-like settings.

### **3. Running the Load Test**
Once the echo server is deployed, execute the load tests using the provided [k6 test file](https://github.com/felipemeriga/socket-flow/blob/main/benchmarking/k6/k6.js).

Run the following command on your local machine or from a dedicated testing environment:
```bash
k6 run ./benchmarking/k6/k6.js
```

Wait for the results to be generated, and analyze the performance metrics.

## Results and Observations

The load tests were executed locally and in production-like environments. While local results may vary, they demonstrate the general performance characteristics of each library.

### **Performance Comparison**
After multiple iterations of testing between **socket-flow** and **tokio-tungstenite**, here are the key findings:
- **Throughput**: Socket-flow consistently achieved slightly higher throughput.
- **Session Stability**: Socket-flow demonstrated fewer dropped connections under high load.
- **Latency**: Average latencies were marginally better with socket-flow.

> **Note:** Real-world results may vary based on network conditions, cluster configurations, and hardware resources.
